# IMAD 2016 APP
### About:
I was initially going to use the Graph API and Twitter's Streaming API to set up a social keyword tracker of sorts but I couldn't access my web app or my database so I decided to showcase what I was relatively better at;

Front-end design.

### Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JavaScript

### Software:
* The server runs on NodeJS
* Coded on a Linux workstation with Sublime Text
* CSS beautified with CSSComb

You can view a preview of the web app [here](http://aadithpm.imad.hasura-app.io/), although the server might not be up, in which case, you can't.
