		<h1>Design and whatnot</h1>
		<p>I am Aadith P Madapusi A.K.A <span class="imp"><b>apm</b></span> and I'm an amateur graphic and web designer from Chennai, India. I mainly work with HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript (getting there) and the Bootstrap framework. As of now, I'm pursuing my engineering in a college here.. well, as long as I don't drop out. My interests have been in design since I was 10 years old, and I was lucky enough to land a gig as a vector and concept artist for a little-known initiative when I was 13. I also did a lot of fan art and some commissioned art for a game and for a few people respectively. Recently, I have become really interested in web development, namely front end development. However, I plan to <i>somehow</i> end up as a full stack developer <span class="small">*hopefully*</span>. My other interests also include traditional programming and I'm slowly becoming a big fan of Haskell, as I'm picking it up. I've created simple desktop applications in Java and worked a lot with C. I spend my time playing games, more games, reading Game of Thrones multiple times till the next book comes out, designing webpages and basically being lazy. That being said, I'll surely be open if you want to contact me for front end development offers. My contact info's over <a href="/contact">here</a>. I'm also open to collaborate on open source projects and to discuss job offers/internships.
