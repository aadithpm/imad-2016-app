		As a developer/designer, I've worked on various applications out of my own interest and as part of a college project. I'm very comfortable working with HTML and CSS and the Bootstrap framework, and have enough knowledge of JavaScript to pick up APIs and libraries. I'm working to improve my JS and have my eye on frameworks like NodeJS, AngularJS/React, jQuery and VueJS next. I have also created some projects in C; a student database and a random string generator. That helped me to create a couple of embedded C projects, notably a typing game that randomly generated strings and made use of the hardware to display timers. It was quite fun to create <b>and</b> to play. I've also worked with Java and Swing UI to create desktop applications, albeit my knowledge of the same is entry level. I implemented the C student database of mine in C++ as well, just to get a good grasp of object oriented concepts. Right now, I'm learning Haskell and slowly looking to switch to functional programming, while also making time for JavaScript on the side. I've hugely shifted my work to Linux over the past couple of years and never looked back; git has also been a very good friend. I move a lot between different computers and learning to use git has made sure that I don't lose any continuity over my work. I'm self-taught and I pride myself on picking up concepts quickly, if I say so myself, and am always open to learn and to be creative. I'm also available for front-end design work, graphic design work and content writing. You can <a href="/contact">contact</a> me in a couple of places.
